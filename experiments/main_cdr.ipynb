            "2.  **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV):** The reported vertigo (\"room spinning\") strongly suggests a vestibular component to the dizziness.

            "*   **Tension Headache:** Eye pain and dizziness can be symptoms of a tension headache, but the description of \"room spinning\" makes this less probable as the primary diagnosis.\n",

            "    *   **Neurological Examination:** Assess cranial nerves and cerebellar function to rule out central causes of dizziness.\n",
            "    *   **Dix-Hallpike Maneuver:** Perform this maneuver to assess for BPPV. Observation of nystagmus is diagnostic.\n",
            "2.  **Further History:** Clarify the precise nature and duration of the vertigo episodes. Inquire about associated nausea, vomiting, or hearing loss.\n",
            "3.  **Symptomatic Treatment:**\n",
            "    *   **Viral Pharyngitis:** Recommend rest, hydration, over-the-counter analgesics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for fever and pain, and throat lozenges for sore throat.\n",
            "    *   **BPPV:** If the Dix-Hallpike is positive, perform the Epley maneuver.\n",

            "    *   **CBC:** If fever is high or persistent, consider a complete blood count to rule out bacterial infection.\n",
            "    *   **Sinus CT Scan:** If sinusitis is strongly suspected and symptoms are not improving, consider a CT scan of the sinuses.\n",
